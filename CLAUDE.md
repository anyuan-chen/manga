This is a manga reader focused on language learning. 

We have a set of pdf chapters in /data/chapters.
Users can open these chapters in the web applications in /reader and read the chapter while answering a set of questions generated for the chapter. Their progress is saved in the form of correct answers regarding certain vocab or grammatical structures in the database.

Outside of chapters, they will have the chance to practice with vocab and grammatical structures they have answered incorrectly at /review. This will bring up past panels that they have failed and ask them what is going on in the panel.

User data is persisted in a database with schema available in /Users/andrewchen/Building/manga/frontend/prisma/schema.prisma
